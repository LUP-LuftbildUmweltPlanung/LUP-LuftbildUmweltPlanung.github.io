## Vera Sons
*she/her*

I am a master's student of Computational Science with specialization in Geoscience and Climate physics. I am currently writing my master's thesis about developing a foundation model for German RGBI aerial imagery and am looking forward to continue working on the project afterwards. I am passionate about developing new methods and features or automating workflows. In the field of remote sensing I can contribute this methological interest to make an impact in nature conservation and the fight against climate change.
