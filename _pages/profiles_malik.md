*they/them*

I recently graduated in Aeronautics and Astronautics at the TU Berlin. During my studies I focused on software development, especially neurological models, perception and interpretation, and learning. Outside of my curriculum I worked with autonomous robotic systems, both for use in a lab as well as in more extreme environments. 
At LUP I supported initial implementations of Deep Learning approaches as a student. Now I develop solutions for a variety of optimization problems, including conservation prioritization and hyperparameter optimization.
