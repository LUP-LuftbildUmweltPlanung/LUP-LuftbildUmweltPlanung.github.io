LUP4GeoAI is a dedicated working group focused on advancing AI driven methods to solve nature and climate based challenges. Our mission is to enhance the capabilities of both LUP and the broader geospatial community through innovative research and development. We develop cutting edge AI techniques across a range of domains, including image processing, time series analysis, and natural language processing - mainly based on geospatial data. In an era of rapid AI evolution, our strong international network enables us to stay at the cutting edge of technology. Collaboration is central to our work, close cooperation with other departments at LUP ensures that our methods remain practically relevant and aligned with real world challenges.
