## Benjamin Stöckigt
*he/him*

I studied Geoecology at the University of Potsdam and started working at LUP during my studies. After graduating, I joined LUP full time, where I was fascinated from the very beginning by methods and algorithms - particularly based on Deep Learning. I believe that a well functioning team can tackle even the most challenging problems, especially when diverse perspectives and expertise come together.
