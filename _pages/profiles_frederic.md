## Frederic Sorbe
*he/him*

I hold a Master’s degree in Ecology and Environmental Planning, with a strong background in GIS. My Master’s thesis focused on habitat analysis. This increased my interest in machine learning and its potential to advance nature conservation through data-driven approaches and innovative analysis methods.
