*he/him*

I hold an MSc in [Remote Sensing, Geoinformation, and Visualization](https://up-rs-esp.github.io/msc-rsiv/) from the University of Potsdam. With a background in geology and over 4 years of experience as a petrophysicist in the oil industry, I transitioned into environmental monitoring and remote sensing.  
My thesis focused on classifying forest vitality using satellite time series data and the Random Forest algorithm, with a seasonal analysis approach to detect forest disturbances. Currently, I apply object detection and semantic segmentation models in remote sensing projects, particularly for vegetation and land cover analysis.  
I enjoy combining remote sensing, data science, and machine learning to derive meaningful insights from environmental data. You can often find me learning new Python techniques or exploring AI applications in Earth Observation.
